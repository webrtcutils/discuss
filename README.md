The "mailing list"

This is a general discussion repository for projects under the [Webrtcutils](https://github.com/webrtcutils).

## Guidelines

* [Open an issue](https://github.com/webrtcutils/discuss/issues/new) on this repository with your topic or question, providing as much detail as possible. The more we know, the better we can help.
* Follow the [Conference Code of Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com). **tl;dr: Don't be a Jerk**
* Before posting, search the repository to see if there's already an issue opened to avoid duplicates.
* If you think something is a bug or a limitation, post your issue in the relevant repository first. If you are not sure, you are in the right place.
